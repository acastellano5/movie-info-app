## Description
Welcome to my Movie Info App. This app was created with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Vanilla Javascript. In order for the app to work, I am using the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). In this app, you are able to search for movies by name. Additionally, you have the option to search for movies by genre with the buttons on the top of the screen. Enjoy!!
